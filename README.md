Platform to Predict Vaccination

Vaccination plays a vital part in public health care and is one of the most time-consuming processes on the planet. In this study, we look into how machine learning approaches may be used to predict vaccination willingness. Artificial Intelligence's goal is to make computers more effective in tackling difficult healthcare problems, and we may utilize computers to understand data obtained from various surveys. It aids in the early discovery and resolution of numerous issues that impact immunization rates. Computer-assisted diagnosis, decision support systems, expert systems, and software implementation have all demonstrated their value in health care, with various algorithms reducing mistakes and controlling disease development. " The study focuses on the 2009 human flu outbreak, sometimes known as "swine influenza" or H1N1 influenza, in which vaccination has proven challenging. Data mining and machine learning approaches, for example, are non-clinical tools that might aid with this. Using Machine Learning Classification Algorithms, this study will examine the H1N1 Vaccination Progress in the United States. The paper's conclusions reveal which method is best for a taken dataset. The suggested infrastructure in this study can assist vaccine providers by giving external Machine Learning support.
